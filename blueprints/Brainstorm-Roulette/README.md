# Brainstorm Roulette Mind-Mapper

This is a creativity-boosting tool that helps users brainstorm solutions and spark fresh ideas through structured randomness. You start with a central topic or question, and the app generates random related prompts—words, images, or concepts—sourced from a built-in list or external APIs (e.g., LLMs). These prompts appear as draggable, connectable nodes in a dynamic mind map.

The tool acts like a visual idea jam partner—part mind map, part random prompt generator—helping users overcome “blank page syndrome.” It’s lightweight, requires no login, and stores your session in browser memory. Users can export their mind maps as images or text outlines.

By blending randomness with a visual, interactive canvas, this tool offers a unique and elegant way to brainstorm, ideate, and explore creative problems on the fly.
