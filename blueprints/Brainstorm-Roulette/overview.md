# Brainstorm Roulette Mind-Mapper

## App Idea
- **Name**: Brainstorm Roulette
- **Tagline**: A creativity-boosting tool that sparks fresh ideas through structured randomness.

## Motivation
- **Problem Statement**: Many users face "blank page syndrome" when trying to brainstorm or generate new ideas. Traditional brainstorming methods can be limiting or uninspiring.
- **Target Audience**: Creative professionals, problem solvers, students, writers, designers, and anyone looking to generate fresh ideas or overcome creative blocks.
- **Why Now?**: With the rise of remote work and digital collaboration, there's an increasing need for innovative digital tools that stimulate creativity in a visual, interactive way.

## Reasoning
- **Value Proposition**: Blends randomness with a visual, interactive canvas to offer a unique and elegant way to brainstorm, ideate, and explore creative problems on the fly.
- **Competitive Analysis**: Unlike traditional mind-mapping tools that only organize existing ideas, Brainstorm Roulette actively generates prompts to inspire new connections. Unlike AI writing assistants, it focuses on visual relationships and user-directed exploration.

## Architecture
- **Overview**: A browser-based application with a dynamic canvas for mind mapping and a randomness engine for prompt generation.
- **Key Components**:
  - Interactive Canvas: For creating and connecting idea nodes
  - Prompt Generator: Produces random related words, images, or concepts
  - Storage Manager: Handles session persistence
  - Export Engine: Converts mind maps to shareable formats
- **Data Flow**: User inputs a central topic → System generates random prompts → User interacts with prompts on canvas → Connections form a mind map → User can export or continue ideation

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with a modern framework (React/Vue.js)
- **Backend**: Lightweight or serverless for API integration
- **Database**: Browser storage (localStorage/IndexedDB) for session persistence
- **Other Tools**: External APIs for prompt generation (potentially LLMs), Canvas/SVG libraries for visualization

## Features
- **Core Features**:
  - Dynamic mind-mapping canvas with draggable, connectable nodes
  - Random prompt generation from built-in lists or external APIs
  - No login required, session stored in browser memory
  - Export mind maps as images or text outlines
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Collaborative real-time sessions
  - Custom prompt libraries
  - Advanced theme and visualization options
  - Integration with project management tools
  - Mobile app version

## Development Plan
- **Milestones**:
  1. Prototype of basic canvas and node system
  2. Implementation of random prompt generation
  3. Storage and session management
  4. Export functionality
  5. UI/UX refinement
  6. Beta testing and feedback collection
  7. Initial release

## Additional Notes
- The tool should maintain a balance between randomness and relevance in its prompts.
